[1] The objective of the game is to get a better hand than the dealer's hand, without its value exceeding 21.
[2] Numbered cards are counted as their respective value. Jacks, queens and kings are counted as 10. Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11.
[3] A hand with only a value-10-card and an ace is known as a blackjack. A blackjack beats all other hands, even those valued 21.
[4] At the start of a round, each player makes an inital bet of $5, $10, $20, $40 or $80.
[5] After the initial bets are placed, the dealer deals himself one card, face up. Each player is then dealt two cards in turn, face up.
[6] After being dealt their hand, each player has a choice to stand, hit, or double.
[7] Hitting means being dealt another card, adding it to the value of the hand. A player may hit as many times as they like, unless their hand breaks 21.
[8] If the value of a hand breaks 21, the hand loses and is discarded. Any bet placed on it is lost.
[9] Standing means refusing any more cards, waiting for the round to be resolved.
[10] Doubling means to double one's initial bet, pledging to stand after the next card is dealt.
[11] Surrendering (giving up one's stake in return for half of the initial bet) is not allowed.
[12] If a player is dealt a pair (two cards of the same value) they may choose to split them into two hands. A second bet must be made for the second hand.
[13] If a player splits a pair of aces, only one more card is dealt to each hand.
[14] If the dealer's first card is an ace, players may buy insurance. This is a side bet at half the amount of the original bet, that pays out if the dealer's next card gives them a blackjack.
[15] The dealer must hit on 17 or lower (including a "soft 17" which includes an ace), and must stand on 18 or higher. The may not split, double down or surrender.
[16] If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they lose, and each player's bet is paid out.
[17] Winning hands pay 1 to 1, meaning an initial bet of $10 would pay $20.
[18] Blackjacks pay 3 to 2, meaning an initial bet of $10 would pay $25.
[19] Insurance bets pay 2 to 1, meaning an inital bet of $10 would pay $30. Insurance bought when the player has a blackjack ("even money") is paid out immediately, with a sum equal to the intial wager.
[20] If the player's hand and the dealer's hand tie, the bet is returned to the player.
[21] The acrds are dealt from a single deck, which is shuffled before each new round of play.
