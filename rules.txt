[1] The objective of the game is to get a better hand than the dealer's hand, without its value exceeding 21.
[2] Numbered cards are counted as their respective value. Jacks, queens and kings are counted as 10. Aces can be counted as either 1 or 11.
[3] A hand with only a value-10-card and an ace is known as a blackjack. A blackjack beats all other hands, even those valued 21.
[4] At the start of a round, each player makes an inital bet of $5, $10, $20, $40 or $80.
[5] After the initial bets are placed, the dealer deals himself one card, face up. Each player is then dealt two cards in turn, both face up.
[6] After being dealt their hand, each player has a choice to stand, hit, or double.
[7] Hitting means being dealt another card, adding it to the value of the hand. A player may hit as many times as they like, unless their hand breaks 21.
[8] If the value of a hand breaks 21, the hand loses and is discarded. Any bet placed on it is lost.
[9] Standing means refusing any more cards, waiting for the round to be resolved.
[10] Doubling means to double one's initial bet, pledging to stand after the next card is dealt.
[11] Surrendering (giving up one's stake in return for half of the initial bet) is not allowed.
[12] If a player is dealt a pair (two cards of the same value) they may choose to split them into two hands. A second bet, equal to the first, must be made for the second hand.
[13] If a player splits a pair of aces, only one more card is dealt to each hand.
[14] After a split, an ace and a value-10-card count as 21, not as a blackjack.
[15] If the dealer's first card is an ace, players may buy insurance. This is a side bet at half the amount of the original bet, that pays out if the dealer's next card gives them a blackjack.
[16] After each player has chosen to stand, or broken 21, the dealer deals cards to themselves. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they lose, and each player's bet is paid out.
[17] The dealer must hit on 16 or lower and on a "soft 17" (a value-17 hand that includes an ace) and must stand on 17 or higher. The may not split, double or surrender.
[18] Winning hands pay 1 to 1, meaning an initial bet of $10 would pay $20.
[19] Blackjacks pay 3 to 2, meaning an initial bet of $10 would pay $25.
[20] Insurance bets pay 2 to 1, meaning an inital bet of $10 would pay $30. Insurance bought when the player has a blackjack ("even money") is paid out immediately, with a sum equal to the intial wager.
[21] If the player's hand and the dealer's hand tie, the bet is returned to the player.
